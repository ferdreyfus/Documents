## GG Overview

Guld Games (gg) is a group of competitive gamers who track their results on the [GG ledger](https://github.com/guld-games/ledger-gg). Starting with in person games, like friends playing texas hold'em, GG will add more games and play options, including eventually automated, provably fair options.

## GG Token & Economics

Members may wager on games, and/or create in-games payments. All of these payments must be made in in the GG token to qualify for tracking in the gg group. At any point, guld group members may burn GULD to acquire GG, or one player can send GG to another via a transfer.
